                    <h2>Welcome to the Croissant Marketplace SDK Creator Guide!</h2>
                    <p>As a creator, you can make your game compatible with the Croissant Marketplace SDK using the following API features or libraries.</p>
                    <p>The Croissant Marketplace SDK is a set of API features and libraries that allow you to make your game compatible with the Croissant Marketplace. It's completely free, and it offers you the potential to monetize your creations effectively.</p>
                    <p>Here is a list of the features you can use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Retrieve all items available in the marketplace</b>: you can list all available items in the marketplace.</li>
                        <li><b>Check if a user possesses a specific item</b>: you can check if a user possesses a specific item of yours for example.</li>
                        <li><b>Get the inventory details of a user</b>: you can get the inventory details of a user, and make your own inventory viewer, or check if a user possesses a specific item of yours.</li>
                        <li><b>Allow users to purchase items from the marketplace</b>: you can allow users to purchase items from the marketplace, potentially making money from your creations.</li>
                        <li><b>Give items to users as a seller</b>: you can give items to users as a seller without the user having to use the /buy command. This is useful for giveaways, or for selling items to users with your own pricing and payment system, opening up new revenue streams.</li>
                        <li><b>Consume an item from a user's inventory</b>: you can consume an item from a user's inventory. This is useful for games where users can consume items to gain a buff or effect, and remove them from their inventory.</li>
                        <li><b>Open a bundle for a user and retrieve the items inside</b>: you can open a bundle your created with <strong>/create-bundle</strong><i>(SOON!)</i> with your items for a user and retrieve the items inside. This is useful for games where users can open bundles to gain items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An API key is required to use the API. You can get one via the <strong>/api-key</strong> command. This ensures that only your game can use the API for your items and not the others creators.</p>
                    <p>The API key system is not stocked in database, so it's ensure security. You can find more information about the API <a href="/api-docs">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Utilize these endpoints to enhance your game's interaction with the Croissant Marketplace and provide a seamless experience for your users. Remember, all these features are completely free, and they offer you the potential to monetize your creations effectively.</p>
